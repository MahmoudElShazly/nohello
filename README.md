# Nohello

This is the source of [this](https://sbmueller.github.io/nohello/) website.

## Build

To generate the HTML file from Markdown,
[markdown-styles](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles) is used:

```
generate-md --layout=github --input index.md --output .
```

## Acknowledgements

This website was copied from the original at nohello.com. Acknowledgements
go to the original anonymous author. I felt an urge to modernize this gem with
a more suitable layout, https connection and open-sourced code.
